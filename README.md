# Learning Objectives

  - Define database, table, row, and column
  - Understand the difference between database and DBMS
  - Basic SQL language: SELECT and WHERE
  - Launching `sqlite3` on the command line
    - Using database file command line argument
    - Issuing SQL commands from the commandline and from text files
  - Working on assignments with Github Codespaces

# Introduction

Make sure you read chapter 1.1 of the textbook https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/practical_db/PART1_SQL/01-sql-basics/sql-basics.html, as well as the SELECT BASIC tutorial from https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_basics 

The database for all the textbook examples are stored in the database file `textbook.db`.

Complete the following exercises.  You will need to create a separate text file for each question in the form
of 1.sql, 2.sql etc. Each text file will contain a single sql command.

You can access the sql prompt using the command:

```
$ sqlite3 textbook.db
```
